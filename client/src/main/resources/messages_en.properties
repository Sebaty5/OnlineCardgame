rules=Preparation\n\nDurak is played with a deck of 52 cards (2?10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) by two to six players. Each player receives six cards and the trump card is chosen, which is displayed next to the draw pile.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nPlay proceeds clockwise and in rounds. A round begins with the attacker attacking the player to their left, the defender. If the defender is able to block, the round is over, and they begin a new round with their own attack to the left. However, if the defender must pick up the pieces, they may not attack themselves. The next player then begins their attack.\n\n\nGame start\n\nTo start the game, the host must click Start. At the beginning, everyone has 6 cards. The attacker is randomly selected and initiates the first attack.\n\n\nAttack\n\nThe attack begins with the revealing of cards, which the defender must beat (higher value trumps, lower value, trump beats non-trump). Multiple cards can be revealed, as long as they have the same value. Other players can add more cards to the attacker, provided their values ??match those already revealed in the fight (however, a maximum of six cards is allowed). This occurs in a fixed order.\n\n\nDefense\n\nThe defender can beat the cards presented to him with cards of the same suit and higher value. Cards of the trump suit beat all other suits. Trumps can therefore only be beaten by higher trumps. The card to be beaten is covered with the beating card. The defender can only be beaten with as many cards as he has in his hand, but no more than six. The defense is successful when all attacking cards have been beaten according to the rules above and the remaining players are unwilling or unable to add any more. The beaten cards are eliminated from the game and the round is over. If the defender cannot beat all cards, for example because he does not have the right suit, has too low a value, or too few trumps, the round ends with him taking all the cards that were beaten in that round and are still face up. If the cards cannot be beaten, the attackers may continue to throw in cards of the same value ? but no more than six.\n\n\nEnd of the round\n\nAt the end of a round, all players must draw cards from the deck until each player has exactly six in their hand. The original attacker draws first, followed by the defender. This is strategically important, as the last card is inevitably a trump, and a successful cutoff towards the end increases the likelihood of being eliminated. Once the deck is exhausted, play continues without drawing any more cards. Whoever has gotten rid of all their cards is successfully eliminated from the game.\n\n\nEnd of game\n\nThe game ends when only one player has cards left in their hand. This player is the loser, the Durak.
